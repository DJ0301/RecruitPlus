# Recruit+ - Digital Recruitment Solution App

Recruit+ is a digital recruitment solution app aimed at providing a seamless hiring experience for multiple MNCs (Multinational Corporations). 
This React application utilizes Tailwind CSS, npm, and Bootstrap to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

In this project, I utilized AI tools from sites like Wepik to generate realistic and diverse images of people. These AI-generated images helped 
enhance the visual appeal of the application, providing a vibrant and engaging user experience. The use of AI technology allowed for the 
creation of unique and dynamic visuals that perfectly complemented the digital recruitment solution offered by Recruit+.
